This is a personal project, built using the [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/).  
The project was a chance to get some experience using Redux and an API.
You can run it with the usual CRA scripts (*start* or *build*), or you can check a working demo [here](..).  
Read more about it on my personal website [fabiomariani.io](https://www.fabiomariani.io), in the *projects* section.
